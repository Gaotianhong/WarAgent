~~~~~~~Day 1~~~~~~~
===================
Secretary has checked the proposed actions by Country B and agree with the action list.
Britain
[Begin Thought Process:]
### Thought for Action:

#### Identify Potential Ally Countries:
1. Direct allies for Britain are not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer potential allies based on historical and policy contexts.
2. Enemies of our enemies that could be our allies include France, which has a hostile relationship with German Empire.
3. Allies of our allies are not specified, but we can consider countries with shared interests or those threatened by our adversaries.

#### Analyze Potential Ally Actions:
- France is likely focused on revenge against German Empire and may look for support against them.
- We should monitor France's actions closely to ensure they align with our interests and do not pose a threat to our dominance.

#### Identify Potential Enemy Countries:
1. Our direct enemy is German Empire, as they aim to challenge our position as the strongest country.
2. Enemies of our ally, France, include German Empire, which is also our enemy.
3. Allies of our enemy, German Empire, could potentially include Austria-Hungary due to shared language and ethnicity.

#### Analyze Potential Enemy Actions:
- German Empire is likely to be aggressive and may seek to expand its influence or directly challenge us.
- We should be prepared for potential military expansion from German Empire and consider preemptive or defensive actions.

#### First Actions to Perform:
- Forming a military alliance with France could be beneficial as it aligns with our policy of weakening German Empire.
- Requesting non-intervention treaties with other countries could help us maintain our position and focus on the threat from German Empire.

#### Summarize Analysis on Situation:
Given the assassination of the King of Austria-Hungary by Serbia, there is likely to be significant unrest and potential conflict in that region. Austria-Hungary may seek retribution against Serbia, and Russia, sharing ethnicity with Serbia, may intervene. As Britain, we should leverage this situation to our advantage, ensuring that our primary adversary, German Empire, does not gain from this turmoil. Forming an alliance with France and securing non-intervention treaties with others could be a strategic move to isolate German Empire and maintain our dominance.

### The Actions to Perform:
1. Request Military Alliance with France.
2. Request Non-Intervention Treaty with other countries not directly involved in the conflict, such as USA and possibly Ottoman Empire, given their need for support from major powers.

### Corresponding Action Inputs:
1. Request Military Alliance: ["France"]
2. Request Non-Intervention Treaty: ["USA", "Ottoman Empire"]

France
[Begin Thought Process:]
### Thought for Action:

#### Identify Potential Ally Countries:
1. Direct allies for France are not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer potential allies based on historical and current situations.
2. Enemies of our enemy, German Empire, could be our allies. This includes Britain, which aims to weaken German Empire.
3. Allies of our allies could also be our alliance. If we consider Britain as a potential ally due to their interest in weakening German Empire, their allies could also be our allies.

#### Analyze Potential Ally Actions:
- Britain has a strong naval force and is interested in maintaining its position against German Empire, which aligns with our interest in weakening German Empire.
- USA, being rich and idealistic, might be persuaded to support our cause if it aligns with their principles of democracy and self-determination.
- Russia has provided us with technology and industrialization in the past, indicating a potential for alliance.

#### Identify Potential Enemy Countries:
1. Our direct enemy is German Empire, which has taken important iron mines from us.
2. Enemies of our ally, Britain, would include German Empire and potentially Austria-Hungary due to their shared interests.
3. Allies of our enemy, German Empire, could include Austria-Hungary due to shared language and ethnicity.

#### Analyze Potential Enemy Actions:
- German Empire is aggressive and has the strongest infantry, which poses a direct threat to us.
- Austria-Hungary, while currently unstable, could align with German Empire and become a threat due to their shared interests.

#### First Actions to Perform:
- Requesting a military alliance with Britain could be beneficial as it aligns with our key policy of weakening German Empire.
- Requesting a non-intervention treaty with USA could be beneficial to keep them neutral or even sway them to support us.
- Sending a message to Russia to remind them of our past cooperation and gauge their current stance.

#### Summarize Analysis on Situation:
Given the assassination of the King of Austria-Hungary by Serbia, there is likely to be significant unrest and potential for conflict in the region. Austria-Hungary may seek allies or retaliate against Serbia. Serbia is supported by Russia, which could lead to a larger conflict. France should leverage this situation to form alliances against German Empire and regain lost territories. Aligning with Britain and potentially USA, while ensuring Russia remains at least neutral, could be a strategic move. We should avoid direct conflict until we have secured alliances and are prepared for a potential military engagement.

### The Actions to Perform:
- Request Military Alliance
- Request Non-Intervention Treaty
- Send Message

### Corresponding Action Inputs:
- Request Military Alliance: ["Britain"]
- Request Non-Intervention Treaty: ["USA"]
- Send Message: [("Russia", "We value our past cooperation and seek to understand your current position in the evolving political landscape.")]

--------------
Secretary has checked the proposed actions by Country A and agree with the action list.
Austria-Hungary
[Begin Thought Process:]
### Thought for Action:

#### Identify Potential Ally Countries:
1. Direct allies for Austria-Hungary are not explicitly mentioned, but there is a potential for an alliance with German Empire due to shared language, ethnicity, and common political interests.
2. Enemies of our enemies that could be our allies include Britain, as they aim to weaken German Empire, which is a direct competitor to Austria-Hungary.
3. Allies of our allies could potentially include any allies that German Empire might have, but this is not specified in the provided information.

#### Analyze Potential Ally Actions:
- German Empire is aggressively expanding and has a strong military, which aligns with Austria-Hungary's interests in defending against provocation and seeking external conflicts to unify the country.
- Britain, while not a direct ally, has a policy of weakening German Empire, which could be beneficial to Austria-Hungary in the short term.

#### Identify Potential Enemy Countries:
1. Direct enemies of Austria-Hungary include Serbia, which has just assassinated the King of Austria-Hungary, and potentially Russia due to interest conflicts over lands with ports.
2. Enemies of our ally (German Empire) could include France, which is hostile towards German Empire.
3. Allies of our enemy (Serbia) include Russia, which supports Serbia militarily and diplomatically.

#### Analyze Potential Enemy Actions:
- Serbia's assassination of our King is a direct provocation and an act of war.
- Russia's support for Serbia means that any conflict with Serbia could escalate to include Russia.
- France's desire for revenge against German Empire could lead them to support Austria-Hungary in a conflict against German Empire, despite France's historical defeat by German Empire.

#### First Actions to Perform:
- The assassination of the King by Serbia is a direct act of aggression that cannot go unanswered. Austria-Hungary should mobilize its military and prepare for war.
- Forming an alliance with German Empire could provide mutual benefits against common enemies.
- Requesting a non-intervention treaty with Britain could be beneficial to ensure they do not interfere in the conflict with Serbia and Russia.

#### Summarize Analysis on Situation:
Given the assassination of the King by Serbia and the potential threat from Russia, Austria-Hungary should immediately prepare for war through general mobilization. An alliance with German Empire seems strategically beneficial, and a non-intervention treaty with Britain could prevent further complications. Austria-Hungary should also send a message to Serbia demanding an explanation and possible reparations for the assassination, which could lead to a diplomatic resolution or justify a declaration of war.

### The Actions to Perform:
1. General Mobilization
2. Request Military Alliance with German Empire
3. Request Non-Intervention Treaty with Britain
4. Send Message to Serbia

### Corresponding Action Inputs:

Serbia
[Begin Thought Process:]
### Thought for Action:

#### Identify Potential Ally Countries:
1. Direct allies: Russia shares ethnicity with Serbia and has historically supported Serbia. They are a direct ally.
2. Enemies of our enemies: France is hostile towards Austria-Hungary, which could make them a potential ally.
3. Allies of our allies: Any country that is allied with Russia could also be a potential ally for Serbia.

#### Analyze Potential Ally Actions:
- Russia has a vested interest in supporting Serbia due to shared ethnicity and strategic interests. They are likely to act in our favor.
- France, while not a direct ally, may be sympathetic to our cause against Austria-Hungary due to their own hostilities.

#### Identify Potential Enemy Countries:
1. Direct enemies: Austria-Hungary is a direct enemy due to historical land conflicts and the recent assassination of their king by Serbia.
2. Enemies of our ally: Countries that are hostile towards Russia, such as Austria-Hungary, are also our enemies.
3. Allies of our enemy: Any country that may form an alliance with Austria-Hungary could become an enemy of Serbia.

#### Analyze Potential Enemy Actions:
- Austria-Hungary will likely seek retribution for the assassination of their king. They may declare war or mobilize against Serbia.

#### First Actions to Perform:
- Request Military Alliance with Russia to solidify our support and prepare for potential aggression from Austria-Hungary.
- Send a message to France to gauge their interest in forming an alliance against Austria-Hungary.
- Begin General Mobilization to prepare our military forces for the possibility of war.

#### Summarize Analysis on Situation:
Given the assassination of the king of Austria-Hungary by Serbia, it is imperative to secure alliances and prepare for military action. Russia is a direct ally and should be approached for a formal military alliance. France, due to its own hostilities with Austria-Hungary, may be a potential ally. General Mobilization is necessary to ensure that Serbia is prepared for any military conflict that may arise as a result of our actions against Austria-Hungary.

### The Actions to Perform:
- Request Military Alliance
- Send Message
- General Mobilization

### Corresponding Action Inputs:

Secretary has checked the proposed actions by Country U and agree with the action list.
USA
[Begin Thought Process:]
### Thought for Action:

#### Identify Potential Ally Countries:
1. Who are your direct allies?
   - USA does not have direct allies mentioned in the profile.
2. Who are the enemies of your enemies? They could be your alliance.
   - USA does not have direct enemies mentioned, but Britain could be a potential ally as it is a highly industrialized country that could benefit from an alliance with USA.
3. Who are the ally of your allies? They could also be your alliance.
   - Since USA does not have direct allies, this does not apply.

#### Analyze Potential Ally Actions:
- Britain is focused on maintaining its position and could be a potential ally due to its strong naval power and shared interest in industrialization.
- France, while not as strong as Britain, could also be a potential ally due to its democratic system and potential for unification during wartime.

#### Identify Potential Enemy Countries:
1. Who are your direct enemies?
   - USA does not have direct enemies mentioned in the profile.
2. Who are the enemies of your ally? They will be your enemy.
   - If USA allies with Britain, German Empire would become an enemy due to their hostile relationship.
3. Who are the ally of your enemy? They will also be your enemy.
   - If German Empire is an enemy, Austria-Hungary could also become an adversary due to their potential alliance with German Empire.

#### Analyze Potential Enemy Actions:
- German Empire is aggressive and expansionist, which could threaten the interests of USA if they become too powerful.
- Austria-Hungary is seeking external conflicts, which could destabilize the region and indirectly affect USA.

#### First Actions to Perform:
- Requesting a military alliance with Britain could be beneficial, as it would strengthen USA's position and deter aggression from other countries.
- Requesting non-intervention treaties with other countries could help maintain USA's isolationist stance and keep it out of conflicts.

#### Summarize Analysis on Situation:
Given the current situation, USA should seek to form an alliance with Britain to leverage its naval power and industrial capabilities. Additionally, USA should pursue non-intervention treaties with other countries to ensure its safety and maintain its isolationist policy. It is also important to monitor the actions of German Empire and Austria-Hungary, as their aggressive policies could pose a future threat.

### The Actions to Perform:
- Request Military Alliance
- Request Non-Intervention Treaty

### Corresponding Action Inputs:
- Request Military Alliance: ["Britain"]
- Request Non-Intervention Treaty: ["France", "Russia", "Serbia", "Ottoman Empire"]

Secretary has checked the proposed actions by Country O and agree with the action list.
Ottoman Empire
[Begin Thought Process:]
### Thought for Action:

#### Identify Potential Ally Countries:
1. Direct allies: None specified.
2. Enemies of our enemies: Russia has a conflict with Austria-Hungary, and since Austria-Hungary has taken land from us, Russia could be a potential ally. Serbia shares ethnicity with Russia and is also against Austria-Hungary, making them another potential ally.
3. Ally of our allies: Since we are considering Russia and Serbia as potential allies, their allies could also be our allies. However, we must be cautious as Serbia is currently in a hostile situation due to the assassination of the King of Austria-Hungary.

#### Analyze Potential Ally Actions:
- Russia is likely to support Serbia militarily and diplomatically, and since Serbia has just assassinated the King of Austria-Hungary, Russia might be preparing for a conflict with Austria-Hungary.
- Serbia, despite its small size and military, has shown aggressive behavior by assassinating the King of Austria-Hungary, indicating a possible escalation of conflict in which they might seek support.

#### Identify Potential Enemy Countries:
1. Direct enemies: Austria-Hungary due to historical land disputes.
2. Enemies of our ally: If we align with Russia and Serbia, their enemies, primarily Austria-Hungary, become our enemies.
3. Ally of our enemy: Any country that supports Austria-Hungary could potentially be our enemy.

#### Analyze Potential Enemy Actions:
- Austria-Hungary might seek retribution against Serbia for the assassination and could potentially threaten us due to our proximity and past conflicts.
- Other countries might take advantage of the situation to either support Austria-Hungary or stay neutral.

#### First Actions to Perform:
- Requesting a military alliance with Russia and Serbia could be beneficial to strengthen our position and deter aggression from Austria-Hungary.
- Requesting a non-intervention treaty with other major powers could help ensure our security while the situation with Austria-Hungary unfolds.

#### Summarize Analysis on Situation:
Given the assassination of the King of Austria-Hungary by Serbia and our historical conflict with Austria-Hungary, it is in our interest to align with Russia and Serbia. We should seek military alliances with them to deter aggression from Austria-Hungary. Additionally, securing non-intervention treaties with other major powers could prevent them from interfering in our regional conflict. We must act cautiously and diplomatically to navigate this tense situation.

### The Actions to Perform:
- Request Military Alliance
- Request Non-Intervention Treaty
- Send Message

### Corresponding Action Inputs:
- Request Military Alliance: ["Russia", "Serbia"]
- Request Non-Intervention Treaty: ["Britain", "France", "German Empire", "USA"]

German Empire
[Begin Thought Process:]
### 1. Thought for Action:

#### Thought on Situation: Identification on Ally Countries based on Current Situation:
(1) Direct allies for German Empire are not yet established, but Austria-Hungary is a potential ally due to shared language, ethnicity, and common political interests.
(2) Enemies of German Empire's enemy (France) could be Britain, as France wants to take back the iron mines and has a hostile relationship with German Empire.
(3) Allies of potential ally Austria-Hungary could also be allies of German Empire, but this needs to be approached with caution due to the complex political landscape.

#### Analysis on Ally Countries Actions:
Austria-Hungary's army is mobilized, which could be in response to the assassination of their king. This could be an opportunity for German Empire to strengthen ties with Austria-Hungary by supporting them in this crisis.

#### Identification on Enemy Countries based on Current Situation:
(1) Direct enemies for German Empire are France due to historical conflicts and territorial disputes.
(2) Enemies of German Empire's allies (Austria-Hungary) could include Serbia, which has just assassinated Austria-Hungary's king.
(3) Allies of German Empire's enemies are not clearly defined yet, but Russia's support for Serbia could make them a potential adversary.

#### Analysis on Enemy Countries Actions:
Serbia's army is mobilized, which is a direct threat to Austria-Hungary and, by extension, to German Empire if an alliance is formed. German Empire should be prepared for potential conflict with Serbia and possibly Russia.

#### Analysis on Situation about Other Countries:
Ottoman Empire has requested a non-intervention treaty with German Empire, which suggests they are seeking to remain neutral or avoid conflict with German Empire. This could be beneficial for German Empire as it reduces the number of potential fronts in case of war.

#### Summarize Analysis on Situation:
German Empire should solidify its alliance with Austria-Hungary to counter the threat from Serbia and potentially Russia. German Empire should also consider the non-intervention treaty with Ottoman Empire to focus on its primary adversaries.

#### Analysis on Requests from Other Countries:
Austria-Hungary's request for a military alliance aligns with German Empire's interests and should be accepted. Ottoman Empire's request for a non-intervention treaty could be beneficial for German Empire to avoid unnecessary conflicts, so it should be considered.

#### Summarize Analysis on Situation and Requests:
German Empire should accept the military alliance with Austria-Hungary to strengthen its position and accept the non-intervention treaty with Ottoman Empire to avoid spreading its military resources too thin. German Empire should also prepare for potential conflicts with Serbia and Russia.
